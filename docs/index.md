!!! note

    Currently RoSys is mostly tested and developed on the [Zauberzeug Robot Brain](https://www.zauberzeug.com/product-robot-brain.html) which uses [Lizard](https://lizard.dev/) for communication with motors, sensors and other peripherals.
    But the software architecture of RoSys also allows you to write your own actors if you prefer another industrial PC or setup.
